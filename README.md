## Summary 
The script can be modified to get the most quantity of votes from different cities assuming that the data includes this kind of information. Breaking down the analysis this way we could go deeper in the analysis. 

The code can also be changed to determine patterns testing the percentage of votes by city against each candidate. This would tell us which candidate was the most popular in each city or county.
